For those using Python, an even easier option is to store the grid in a dict with either (x,y) tuples or complex (x+y*1j) coordinates. When querying from the dict, use blah.get(coord, '.') and you'll never have an out of bounds concern. Then just iterate over min - 1 to max + 1 for both dimensions.

You can also use collections.defaultdict and a custom function that returns whatever the desired default value is. In this case you could do something like:

from collections import defaultdict
grid = collections.defaultdict(lambda: '.')
print(grid[20]) # => .

Or whatever you want the default to be.

You can write:

grid = collections.defaultdict(str)

as str is a function (well, a constructor) that returns an empty string.
